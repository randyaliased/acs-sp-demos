# Acoustic signal processing demos 

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks used to demonstrate several concepts in signal processing primarily with acoustic signals. The demos are interactive in the sense that the acoustic signals used will be recorded and reproduced using your device's microphone and loudspeaker.
